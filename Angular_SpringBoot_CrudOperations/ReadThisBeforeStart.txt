I have done Data insertion retrieval update delete  operations using Angular 11 front end and SpringBoot 4+ JPA 
as backend with Mysql & SQL Server Databases.

I have used database master for both the databases.
So please change your database name , username, password accordingly in spring boot application properties.

I have mentioned both database properties in spring boot properties and comment other whichever is not necessary.
